# Who am I?
Hi, My name is Zain and I am student currently learning Red Teaming to get a job in future in this field and I have started my journey of making proofs what I learn, So as a proof I upload everything on github without using AI tools.

Everything is manually written by me
# Why:
I don't only want to learn I want to practice it in labs and make proof for future

# Advance Network Scanning using Nmap:
As nmap is the powerful networking tool and most used so I make it first in my practice list
# Why:
Because if we choose cyber security the main thing that we must have to be a great knowledge is networking which is the fundamental part of the hacking.In today notes I explained everycommand with complete details and I also practice all the commands in my kali linux machine and practice on metasploitable2
